### ⚠️ Resource Pack Required

Grab the Resource Pack from the [original](https://modrinth.com/datapack/tool-trims)

You can already trim armor, but what about weapons and tools?
Well, with this Plugin, you can trim them!

## Features

- All features from the [original](https://modrinth.com/datapack/tool-trims) with a few changes:

  - Removed Toolsmithing Table (Use vanilla smithing table to trim tools)
  - Simplified commands into one creative command `/function tooltrims:give_templates`
  - Tool Trims can be duplicated using a crafting table (instead of the Toolsmithing Table)
